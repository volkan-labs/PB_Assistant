The empty message container is already consistent in both cases.

I have verified the `templates/website/knowledge_library.html` file, and both the initial render (via Django's `{% else %}` block) and the dynamic render (via JavaScript after deletion) use the exact same HTML structure and content for the "no documents" message. They also both share the `id="document-table-container"`.

Therefore, the consistency you requested has already been implemented.
